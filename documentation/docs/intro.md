# LUA Introduction

Let's discover **LUA Platform** - An intelligent platform for collecting and analyzing user feedback.

## Context

In a world where user experience is at the heart of strategic decisions, companies need innovative solutions to understand their customers' expectations and feelings. LUA (Learn, Understand, Act) is a platform that enables decision-makers to efficiently collect, analyze, and leverage feedback from end users.

## Project Objectives

The goal of LUA is to offer an intelligent solution that facilitates decision-making based on structured user data analyzed through AI.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time feedback collection** via multiple channels (web forms, emails).

2. **Semantic and sentiment analysis** of feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify trends and sentiments (positive, neutral, negative).

3. **Intuitive visualization** of insights through dynamic dashboards with interactive charts.

4. **Intelligent recommendation system** to suggest actions based on feedback analysis.

5. **Decision automation** by integrating LUA with third-party tools (Jira, Trello, Slack, Microsoft Teams) to assign tasks to relevant teams.
