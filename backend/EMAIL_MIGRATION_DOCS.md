# Email Service Migration and Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration from SendGrid to Resend

- **Replaced SendGrid dependency** with Resend in `package.json`
- **Updated imports** from `@sendgrid/mail` to `resend`
- **Modified API initialization** to use Resend constructor
- **Updated email sending methods** to use Resend's API format
- **Fixed environment variable** format in `.env` file (removed spaces around equals sign)

### 2. Async Email Sending with Delay

#### Features Added:

- **1.5 second delay** between consecutive email sends
- **Async email processing** to prevent blocking operations
- **Batch email sending** functionality for multiple emails
- **Email tracking** with result logging and email IDs
- **Delay mechanism** that tracks last email sent time

#### Implementation Details:

```javascript
// Track last email sent time to implement delay
let lastEmailSentTime = 0;
const EMAIL_DELAY_MS = 1500; // 1.5 seconds

// Helper function to add delay between emails
const waitForEmailDelay = async () => {
  const now = Date.now();
  const timeSinceLastEmail = now - lastEmailSentTime;

  if (timeSinceLastEmail < EMAIL_DELAY_MS) {
    const delayNeeded = EMAIL_DELAY_MS - timeSinceLastEmail;
    logger.info(`Waiting ${delayNeeded}ms before sending next email`);
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delayNeeded));
  }

  lastEmailSentTime = Date.now();
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Functions

#### `sendClusterNotificationEmail()`

- Now includes delay before sending
- Returns Resend email ID for tracking
- Improved error handling and logging

#### `sendTestEmail()`

- Includes delay mechanism
- Enhanced logging with email ID tracking
- Updated messaging to reflect Resend integration

#### `sendBatchEmails()` (NEW)

- Processes multiple emails sequentially with delays
- Supports different email types (test, cluster-notification)
- Returns detailed results for each email
- Comprehensive logging for batch operations

### 4. Environment Configuration

Updated `.env` file format:

```env
# Before (incorrect)
RESEND_API_KEY =

# After (correct)
RESEND_API_KEY=
```

### 5. Testing

Created test files to validate functionality:

- `test-email-delay.js` - Tests complete email functionality with delays
- `test-delay-mechanism.js` - Validates delay timing accuracy

## Benefits

1. **Rate Limiting**: 1.5 second delay prevents API rate limiting issues
2. **Better Performance**: Async operations don't block other processes
3. **Improved Tracking**: Email IDs and detailed logging for monitoring
4. **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple emails
5. **Reliability**: Better error handling and recovery
6. **Cost Effective**: Resend typically offers better pricing than SendGrid

## Usage Examples

### Single Email

```javascript
const result = await emailService.sendClusterNotificationEmail(
  "user@example.com",
  "Organization Name",
  clusterData,
  sentimentPercentage
);
```

### Batch Emails

```javascript
const emailBatch = [
  {
    type: 'test',
    to: 'test@example.com'
  },
  {
    type: 'cluster-notification',
    to: 'admin@example.com',
    organizationName: 'Test Org',
    clusterData: {...},
    sentimentPercentage: 75.2
  }
];

const results = await emailService.sendBatchEmails(emailBatch);
```

## Notes

- The delay mechanism ensures consistent spacing between emails regardless of processing time
- All email operations are fully asynchronous and non-blocking
- The system gracefully handles API key configuration issues
- Email IDs from Resend can be used for delivery tracking and webhook handling
